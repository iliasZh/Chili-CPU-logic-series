# Chili's CPU logic series

This is my [logisim-evolution](https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution/releases) project where I followed [Chili's CPU design series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqCJpWy5Fohdz6Nu2yG6Loubocqk3sRNR).

I gave up after implementing `mov` but that was really fun to follow nonetheless.

Here is [mov r,imm & mov r/r showcase](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10VkdhS7zjMVFiJs3_uPzAnV879TBWs4M/view?usp=sharing).
